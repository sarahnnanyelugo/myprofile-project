                <h1>About Me</h1>
    
               
                <p>Hello! my name is Sarah Nnanyelugo. I am a Frontend Developer and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
                This overtime, has made me passionate about helping startups launch and grow their products.
</p>
<p>My interest in web development started back in 2020 when I took leave from paid employment to nurse my first pregnancy.
I'm a graduate of English/Literature who didn't know the first thing about Software Development, but It was a skill I
longed to acquire. It is true most people see a career path as something you pick once and spend the rest of your
working years excelling in that field. However, I am one of those who see career choices as a rather progressive
decision. I believe that as humans, we have enough creativity and ability to do much more than we limit ourselves to.
This was the school of thought that birthed my career in software development. By the end of 2020, I had learnt HTML,
CSS, Javascript and frameworks such as Bootstrap and jQuery. This story is a little more elabourate than this.
Interested? Continue from my linkedIn page. It's a good read</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, I have been covering grounds in software development and by God's grace, meeting expectations.
Aside from building numerous websites for our clients local and international, I recently had the opportunity of
collaborating in a team of five frontend developers to build SwitchApp, a payment engine for the internet. This was my
first official collaboration experience and it indeed was a great feat for me.
</p>
<p>Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:

    <div id="my-projects">
        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p id="intro">Yeah, I work hard. Each project is unique. Here are some of my works:
</p>
<div class="container-item">

<div class="project-item" ><h2>⭐Airline Booking System</h2>
    <p>This program simulates booking seats on a flight. It includes features like displaying available seats,
    reserving a seat, canceling a booking, and storing passenger details. I also implemented file handling to
    save and retrieve bookings for persistence.
</p>
</div>
<div class="project-item" ><h2>⭐Contacts Manager</h2>
    <p>A small system for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting contact information (like name, phone, and email). It
    uses file storage (e.g., CSV ) with dynamic memory management (malloc, realloc, free). It’s served as a good
    introduction to CRUD operations, file handling, and dynamic data structures in C.
</p>
</div><div class="project-item" ><h2>⭐Coin Game</h2>
    <p>This is a  simple 1D game where a player tries to “catch” coins as they appear randomly. Typically involves generating random
    values for coin positions, letting the player decide moves, and tracking scores.This project helped strengthen my understanding of concepts like
    random number generation, loops, and conditional logic.
</p>
</div>
<div class="project-item" ><h2>⭐Students Grader</h2>
    <p>This is a program that takes student names and scores, then calculates grades based on given criteria (A, B, C, etc.). It also
    computes averages, highest/lowest scores, and display results in a structured way. This project reinforces my understanding of arrays,
    loops, and conditional branching.
